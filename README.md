# AlgoSortVisualizer

AlgoSortVisualizer is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with Java to provide a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. This tool offers insights into how sorting algorithms function and includes features to track the number of array accesses and comparisons made during the sorting process.

## Features
*Visual Representation:* Provides a graphical representation of sorting algorithms to visualize the sorting process step by step.

*Performance Metrics:* Tracks the number of times the array is accessed and the number of comparisons made during sorting.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java IDE
### Installation
*Clone the repository:*
  
git clone https://github.com/ARK-0707/AlgoSortVisualizer.git 

*Navigate to the project directory:*

cd AlgoSortVisualizer

### Performance Metrics
*Array Accesses:* Displays the total number of times the array was accessed during the sorting process.

*Comparisons:* Shows the total number of comparisons made between elements during the sorting process.
